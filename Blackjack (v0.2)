# BLACKJACK
# -KNOWN ISSUES-
# - Aces are worth 1, not 1 or 11 depending on context
# - program throws error when deck is empty (takes several rounds)
# - inconsistent naming scheme, some variables are named like_this, others likethis
# - cutting & shuffling the deck is strictly unnecessary after randomization, just done for fun
# - player and dealer banks can go below 0
# - player can bet any integer, including negative numbers, meaning when you lose you gain money and when you win you lose money.
# - ^ this is pretty funny to me so I might keep it in
# - probably others I know about but can't think of at the moment
